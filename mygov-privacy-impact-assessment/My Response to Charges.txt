Hi, 

I suspect you may have made mistake in creating your letter. 

You claim 3 documents, totaling 5 pages will take: 
An extra 67.2 minutes to find them, and 
a whopping 1279.8 minutes to make a decision on what (if any) to release. 

Given that is is 21 people in a room for more than an hour or almost 3 work days nonstop, 
I believe you have made a mistake. 
If you haven't, please itemise how the time will be spent. 

In addition, 
Given Medicare is an essential service and that it is now impossible to use Medicare online without MyGov, I submit there is an overriding public interest in releasing the Privacy Impact Assessment and that all costs should be waived. 

Thanks, 

Steven Roddis
