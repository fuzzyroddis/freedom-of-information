Dear Department of Human Services,

I note that in order to deal with Medicare electronically, I am
forced
to sign up for an account with myGov.

I am very concerned about my data and my identities being linked
across services.

I have read the Privacy Statement at:
https://my.gov.au/mygov/content/html/privacy.html

The Privacy Statement says that "You may opt out of any further use
of
myGov in which case you can contact Member Services directly".

On the other hand, the Medicare page says that I can't login
*except*
by means of a myGov account. How can it be meaningful to say I can
'opt out' if by doing so I can't reach a service provider?

I am very concerned about the design of the myGov scheme and would
like to request the report arising from the Privacy
Impact Assessment of myGov.

Thanks,

Steven Roddis
